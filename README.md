# TextBasedGameJs
Wanted to try some stuff with javascript string templates
crazy late night coding breakthrough right here

don't use this it's horribly inefficient, it uses over 2gb of ram to render 192 characters, lord knows how that happened

I don't know why I made this I don't even have any intentions to make a text based game
